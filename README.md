This app maps military lodging locations worldwide.

### Description

This application uses Google Maps integration to map and allow navigation to military lodging locations worldwide.  

I developed this app as a culmination project for my internship with GlobalInfoTek Inc through Hiring Our Heroes. When planning trips, I have often wanted to be able to search for military lodging locations at my destination or along my route.  After learning React and playing with mapping integration and APIs in smaller projects I completed for my internship, I decided for my final project I would create a map that allowed me to do that.  I used React to showcase that new skill.  I chose the React-Google-Maps API because it was similar to a Google Map API I had used in the smaller project, but had additional capabilities that allowed for point to point navigation. While gathering requirements and planning the project, I identified eleven different types of military properties spread over approximatley ten different websites.  I was able to inspect the packet and save the JSON file for one website which contained a large number of properties, but for the majority of the rest I had to find another solution.  My internship mentor pointed me to Selenium.  I learned to use the Selenium Web Driver in Python to scrape the data.  I then used pandas and MySQL to convert, normalize, and organize that data I had gathered. I then built the site using React, and HTML, as well as Material UI elements for styling. 

During my time at GlobalInfoTek, I was working with their Senior Software Developer and learning mainly Front-End Design.  This project showcases the technologies I practiced during the internship as well as a few that I needed to learn 
in order to execute the vision I had for the App.

### Previous skills and tools that I was able to practice during the internship:
- HTML
- CSS
- Adobe Illustrator
- MySQL
### New skills that I learned during the internship:
- JavaScript
- React
- Working with Bootstrap library
- Node.js
- REST API integration
### Additional skills I learned during the execution of this project
- Web Scraping using Selenium
- Data manipulation and cleaning in python
- Integrating React-Google-Maps API and Material UI Library  

*Along the way I faced challenges with learning several tools "on the fly" to implement the features I needed.  I have since learned so much more about web design and accessibility, that I plan to revisit this project for my degree Capstone Project and re-design it from start to finish following best practices.  I also plan to implement a back end to allow querying and customized display of properties on the map.*
